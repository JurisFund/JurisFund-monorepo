**JurisFund** is a tokenized private credit protocol backed by consumer pre-settlement funding. This protocol offers investors an opportunity to get exposure to a unique asset class, notable for its lack of correlation with broader market trends and its history of high returns.

Unlike existing real-world asset (RWA)-backed DeFi protocols, JurisFund does not rely on traditional assets like US Treasuries or income- or receivable-backed loans, which are common on platforms such as Centrifuge, Goldfinch, and Huma Finance. The latter, income- or receivable-backed loans, are particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations and disruptions. For instance, Goldfinch has faced challenges due to a lack of direct oversight in the underwriting and servicing of loans, which has caused incidents of bad debts from two pools, leading to a significant amount of default loans totaling 12 million USD.

The JurisFund platform serves two types of users:

- Plaintiffs in personal injury cases who submit their applications for an advance (non-recourse loan) with their pre-settlement claims as collateral
- Crypto investors that deposit USDC into a lending pool for % APY 

These two sides have no direct interaction. The platform serves several functionalities, including:

- Reviewing and underwriting applications for pre-settlement advances (non-recourse loans)
- Constructing a portfolio of diversified cases to reduce risk 
- Automating the process of issuing non-recourse loan, repayment, re-investment, and redemption in a trust-minimized manner
- Providing an intuitive interface for crypto investors to invest USDC into the pool and redeem it on maturity date.
